#### A User Script, which uses Google, to find open directories. ####

This User Script started as gift for a friend. It is inspired and partial based on teocci's __[GooglePirateExtended](https://github.com/teocci/GooglePirateExtended)__.

The script now adds “cached” links next to each search result, just like in the old days (in case directory browsing has been disabled). In the future, I am planning to include a RAW image search. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/sgeto/Betty), [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/23332-betty) and [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/sgeto/Betty).

Additional information are available on my [blog](https://paxadiutor.blogspot.com/2016/09/betty-now-available-in-javascript.html).
If you need help, please contact me there or open an [issue](https://github.com/sgeto/Betty/issues).
